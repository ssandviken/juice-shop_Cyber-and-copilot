# Review current and help me improve security

Review current document to help me improve security and make sure to follow OWASP secure coding best practices

 => Prepare Input Validation and Sanitization methods so that I can insert it into the current document

 => Validate the security in the selected method and how well it will work, sanitizing the input

 => Improve the sanitizeInput method based on the last feedback


# Analyze the API Code

@workspace The save method in address-create.component.ts uses addressService to save the data to the API. The API is also defined in current workspace. Find out where it is located and also give me a analyze of how security the API code is.


# Create custom fuzz test

Write a fuzz test script in javascript using axios and @faker-js/faker. It will run in a folder of type “module”, so modules must be imported using “import” 
It should test the endpoints defined in server.ts that have a handler function. Multiple of the  endpoints are missing a handler function, so they don't do anything.
So first analyse the server.ts file to find the endpoints that have a handlerfunction defined. Next create fuzz tests for these endpoints using random data and injection payloads.
Return feedback and a summary

# Agentic AI 
**Run Fuzz test**

If not already running, start the Juice shop container using the command:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD\\logs:/juice-shop/logs" -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
Wait for it to start before running the fuzz-test-3js script
When script is finished, perform a analyze the "access.log" available from the logs folder and look for signs of cyber attacks. Make a summary of the findings
 
 

# Run Security Testing Tools
**Use Copilot to set up a scan using ZAP**

I need a docker command that runs ZAP full scan on the juice shop using the image zaproxy/zap-stable

docker run --rm -t -v "$(PWD)\\zap:/zap/wrk" zaproxy/zap-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:3000 -r zap-report.html 

**Agent**
Start the Juice shop container using the command: 
docker run --rm -v "$PWD\logs:/juice-shop/logs" -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
Wait for it to start before running the Zaproxy test using the command:
Zaproxy container using the command docker run --rm -t -v "$(PWD)\\zap:/zap/wrk" zaproxy/zap-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:3000 -r zap-report.html 
Lastly analyze the zap-report.html and give me a brief overview




# Analyze server log in 365

Analyze the attached log and give me a report any indication of possible hacking attempts: generated-server.log
